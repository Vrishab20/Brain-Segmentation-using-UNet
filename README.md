# Brain-MRI-Segmentation
Our research focuses on brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans, a process essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. We introduce an optimized U-Net convolutional neural network, meticulously designed for enhanced segmentation accuracy. Trained on a diverse and augmented dataset, our model demonstrates robust generalizability and outperforms traditional methods in delineating tumor boundaries.
Additionally, we developed an interactive visualization tool using Streamlit, providing clinicians with real-time segmentation capabilities and a user-friendly interface to interact with MRI data. Our results indicate significant improvements over current segmentation methods, showcasing the potential for clinical application. This work represents a significant step forward in medical imaging analysis and its practical implementation in healthcare settings.
